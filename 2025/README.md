# Advent of Code 2025

Excuse to teach myself some Kotlin.

## Setup

Compile the binary for each day:

```sh
kotlinc cmd/day-XX.kt -include-runtime -d bin/day-XX.jar
```

Execute the binary against input:

```sh
java -jar bin/day-01.jar path/to/input

# Example text in the data/examples dir
java -jar bin/day-01.jar data/examples/day-01.txt
```
