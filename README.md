# Advent of Code

Attempts at solving problems from Advent of Code 2023 using Clojure.

## Motivation

Excuse to finally learn Clojure.

## Using solutions

For a given day `n`, the solutions in this library can be used as follows:

1. Copy your challenge input to a file (say `resources/inputs/day<n>.txt`).
2. Execute the following command from shell.
```shell
$ lein run -m aoc.2023.day<n>/main "resources/inputs/day<n>.txt"
```
